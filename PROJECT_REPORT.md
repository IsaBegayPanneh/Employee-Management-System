# Employee Management System - Project Report

## Project Overview

The Employee Management System is a full-stack web application built with a Node.js/Express/MongoDB backend and Angular 17 frontend. The system provides role-based access control with three distinct user roles: Admin, HR, and Manager, each with different permissions for managing employee data.

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js
- **Framework**: Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Middleware**: CORS, JSON parsing, authentication guards

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Angular 17 (Standalone Components)
- **Styling**: CSS with modern design patterns (glassmorphism, gradients)
- **HTTP Client**: Angular HttpClient with interceptors
- **Routing**: Angular Router with guards
- **State Management**: Component-based state management

## Development Timeline & Accomplishments

### Phase 1: Initial Setup & Structure
- **Challenge**: Missing frontend files and dependency conflicts
- **Solution**: Updated Angular dependencies and created missing components and services
- **Accomplishment**: Established proper project structure with working frontend and backend

### Phase 2: Backend Development
- **Challenge**: Missing departments route in backend
- **Solution**: Created comprehensive departments API with CRUD operations
- **Accomplishment**: Complete backend API with authentication, employee, and department management

### Phase 3: Database & Seeding
- **Challenge**: Need for test data and proper database initialization
- **Solution**: Created seed script with test users, departments, and employees
- **Accomplishment**: Database populated with realistic test data for development

### Phase 4: Authentication System
- **Challenge**: Login form sending username instead of email
- **Solution**: Updated login component and auth service to use email field
- **Challenge**: Login response handling mismatch
- **Solution**: Corrected frontend to match backend response structure
- **Challenge**: Authentication token management
- **Solution**: Created HTTP interceptor for automatic token inclusion
- **Accomplishment**: Robust authentication system with proper error handling

### Phase 5: User Interface & Styling
- **Challenge**: Outdated UI design
- **Solution**: Implemented modern styling with gradients, glassmorphism, icons, and animations
- **Accomplishment**: Beautiful, responsive, and modern user interface

### Phase 6: Data Management & API Integration
- **Challenge**: Backend employees route returning department objects instead of names
- **Solution**: Fixed backend to transform department field to string name
- **Challenge**: Frontend not matching backend model structure
- **Solution**: Updated frontend components and services to match backend model
- **Accomplishment**: Seamless data flow between frontend and backend

### Phase 7: Role-Based Access Control
- **Challenge**: Need for different permission levels
- **Solution**: Created three separate dashboard components with role-specific permissions
- **Accomplishment**: 
  - **Admin Dashboard**: Full CRUD operations on employees
  - **HR Dashboard**: View-only access to employee data
  - **Manager Dashboard**: Edit-only access to employee data

### Phase 8: Error Handling & User Experience
- **Challenge**: Login errors not displaying properly
- **Solution**: Implemented comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Challenge**: Loading states and user feedback
- **Solution**: Added loading spinners and proper state management
- **Accomplishment**: Smooth user experience with clear feedback

## Major Challenges Faced & Solutions

### 1. Angular 17 Migration Issues
**Challenge**: Angular 17 uses standalone components and functional interceptors
**Solution**: Updated all components to standalone format and converted class-based interceptor to functional interceptor

### 2. Authentication Token Management
**Challenge**: Need to automatically include JWT tokens in API requests
**Solution**: Created HTTP interceptor that adds Authorization header to all requests except login

### 3. Database Schema Evolution
**Challenge**: User model needed to support multiple roles
**Solution**: Updated User model enum to include 'hr' role and removed 'employee' role

### 4. API Response Handling
**Challenge**: Frontend expecting different data structure than backend providing
**Solution**: Aligned frontend models with backend response structure and added data transformation in backend

### 5. Error Message Persistence
**Challenge**: Login error messages being cleared immediately when user types
**Solution**: Implemented error state tracking to preserve login errors until new login attempt

### 6. Change Detection Issues
**Challenge**: UI not updating after data changes
**Solution**: Forced Angular change detection in component methods

### 7. Deprecated Mongoose Methods
**Challenge**: Backend using deprecated `remove()` method
**Solution**: Updated to use `deleteOne()` method with proper error handling

## Role-Based Permissions

### Admin Role
- **Full Access**: Create, Read, Update, Delete employees
- **Department Management**: View all departments
- **User Management**: Full system access

### HR Role
- **Read-Only Access**: View employee data only
- **Department View**: View department information
- **No Modification Rights**: Cannot edit, create, or delete employees
